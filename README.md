## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

- Add .env.local file in the project root
- add VITE_APP_IMITATION_BACKEND_SERVER=http://localhost:8000 in the file

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview the production build.\
This is useful for testing the production build before deploying.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.\
You can add `--fix` flag to automatically fix fixable issues.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner (if configured).\
By default, Vite projects use Vitest for testing.
